Q & A with Client:
  # What platform should this game be able to be run on?
    Python allows for cross-platform development so you shouldn't have to worry about
    developing for different operating systems
  # What type of game should this be?
    I recommend the game be a 2-D side-scrolling platform game
  # Can we include some sort of fake 3-D effects?
    It is optional. You can throw in an effects like parallax or an isometric view if you 
    want. But it is not required
  # What is the target audience for the game?
    The game should be targeted towards all ages of game players. The game is not 
    restricted to just a gamer community either.
  # What genre of game should we make?
    There aren't any restrictions other than it has to be a 2-D side scrolling platform  
    game. But if you would really like to create something different like a Zelda game 
    you can. Just make sure it is fun.
  # How long should the game be?
    The game should have at least 15 minutes of gameplay. Obviously, if I like it and 
    play it for longer, that is better.
  # What rating should we design the game for?
    The game should be rated G. Just use your best judgment and you will be alright. If 
    you would like to have more violence or gore, you can include options to include them 
    in the game
  # Should we include multiplayer aspects?
    For now, no. It would just be too time consuming for the time allotted. It would be 
    easier to include a second player that alternates playing with the first player, than 
    having both play at the same time. You can include that later if you want, but there 
    are no restrictions at this point.
  # Should the player be able to save the game?
    It is up to you, but there will be no requirement for that feature
  # How graphically intense should the game be?
    You can keep it minimal as long as it doesn't look repetitive
  # What should controllers should be used in the game?
    At minimum you should use the keyboard as the game controller. You can add other
    controllers if you like, such as joystick, but it won't be required
  # What resolutions do you want the game to support?
    640x480 to 1024x768
  # Should we include a high score table?
    You can have that, but there definitely needs to be some sort of system to keep track 
    of user progress. Like a high score table, a point system, achievements, etc.
  # How many difficulty levels should there be?
    Just one is required
  # Should we include sound effects?
    Yes, you can use sounds created by others, just make sure you give them credit
  # Should we include a storyline?
    It is not required.
  # Can we use copyrighted material?
    No. <Amendment> You can use copyrighted material because it falls under education 
    use. Just make sure that you give credit to those who created the material you use.  
    And should you later want to market the game you need make sure you switch out the 
    sounds and images that you have used.
  # Should we have AI controlled characters?
    You need to have at least 3 different AI controlled non-playable characters. Be them 
    enemy characters or friendly characters.
  # What is the required frames per second?
    60 frames per second. But if you want to have less you can. As long as I don't notice 
    it during game play
  # What should we use as a benchmark for the game?
    The game should be able to run on the computers in the engineering computer lab. 
  # Can we use other modules and libraries other than pygame?
    You can. Just make sure you let me know what you used, that way I can make sure I 
    have the required material to run the game.
  # What is an acceptable amount of glitches?
    Obviously software will have glitches, but there is enough time to create a playable 
    game with minimal glitches.
